## Hello traveller! 
# My name is Nick Tantra

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on :
- Phase 2 of Aligulac Analytics

ðŸŒ± Having fun in Python.  Interested in scraping and automation after picking up various Machine Learning bits and pieces.

## Projects
Here are some projects developed during my spare time:
- [Aligulac (Starcraft 2 Matches) Analytics](https://github.com/tanhtra/aligulac_analytics)
  Near end-to-end pipeline used to extract match data from [Aligulac.com](http://www.aligulac.com), store the data in (GCP) Cloud Storage Bucket.  Data are then transformed using dbt and MageAI with Streamlit as the end visualisation dashboard.
- [Pipeline Places and Properties](https://github.com/tanhtra/pipeline-places-property)
  End-to-end pipeline that combines data extracted from a custom web-scraper piped in using Confluent-Kafka.  Uses Snowflake as a backend with dbt as the transformation tool to merge the scraped data with the API and custom-seed transit data.  Streamlit was used for the visualisation layer.
